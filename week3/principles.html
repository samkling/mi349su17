    <h2>Ockham's Razor</h2>

    <p>
        Google's homepage perfectly describes ockham's razor. This webpage is super simple. The webpage could be much
        more complicated with different options, ads, and functionlity filling the screen but instead was kept simple allowing for
        an easy search event.

    <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>

    <p>
        Hackerrank's dashboard embodies the rule of thirds distinctly from a horizontal standpoint and vertical standpoint.
        The page is divided into thirds in order to group tracks into different categories but also to make the page look
        aesthetically complete.

    <h2>Chunking</h2>

    <p>
        YouTube does a good job of chunking its homepage into small readable chunks for suggested youtubers and separated from
        videos recommended based on recently watched videos.

    <h2>Mapping</h2>

    <p>
        adhamdannaway.com has one of the coolest homepages I've seen. When you move the mouse across the screen, the image of him
        shifts in color and design. As well a great way of showing his portfolio.

    <h2>Modularity</h2>

    <p>
        Instagram's website does a good job at breakin things into smaller contained systems. Each picture or video has tags, comments,
        and a description. This allows for a sense of a small community within a post.
