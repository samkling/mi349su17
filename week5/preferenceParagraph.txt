I prefer style tiles. I like these better because they donâ€™t necessarily depend on specific information of the site. It could describe a lot of different information, while the comps might have to be changed later to fit the new information. The style tiles took me longer to do because it really made me think about what I want the theme options to be when I create the actual site. While the full comp was fairly straightforward after finishing the style tiles. I think you can get by with just the style tiles because at this point in the design the information could change drastically in the site, and that will have to be recreated.
